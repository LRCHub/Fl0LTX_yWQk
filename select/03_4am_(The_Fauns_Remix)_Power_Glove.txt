Can't sleep... 4am
Rain it taps against the windowpane
Outside... Dead of night
Streets are empty, there's no sign of life

Go outside... It feels right
To wash away your dreams and your desire
But you're not alone, you realise
You try to speak but you can only cry

Try to speak but you can only cry
Try to speak but you can only cry

Wake up... Sleepy eyes
Evaluate the hows and wonder whys
But you can't recall, the face at all
Of the lover from so long ago

Of a love you lost so long ago
The rain fell hard so long ago

You can only cry
You can only cry
You can only cry
You can only cry
